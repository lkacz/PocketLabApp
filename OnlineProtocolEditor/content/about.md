# About PoLA (Pocket Lab App)

A mobile research app for behavioral scientists and field studies.

<table class="meta"><tbody><tr><th>Version</th><td>1.3.4</td></tr><tr><th>Developed by</th><td><i>Łukasz D. Kaczmarek, PhD, Adam Mickiewicz University, Psychophysiology Laboratory</i></td></tr><tr><th>License</th><td>GNU GPLv3 — community contributions are welcome.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Why use PoLA?

PoLA was designed for researchers who need to deliver structured tasks and capture responses in the field. Studies are stored as human-readable text files that PoLA interprets at runtime, enabling rapid iteration, reproducibility, and transparent auditing. Sessions can range from brief questionnaires to multi-stage experiments with timers, branching, custom layouts, and embedded media. 

## Key capabilities

-   **Protocol-driven workflow:** Update tasks instantly by editing a plain-text script—no rebuild required.
-   **Protocol Manager GUI:** Author and troubleshoot studies visually, then refine the underlying script when needed.
-   **Participant experiences:** Combine instructions, timers, scales, free response fields, HTML overlays, audio, video, and images in a single flow.
-   **Flexible styling:** Tune typography, alignment, spacing, and button treatments to match your branding or accessibility goals.
-   **Branching:** Branch to labeled sections to orchestrate complex study paths with simple commands.
-   **Offline-first execution:** Run complete studies without a network connection and export data stored locally when ready.
-   **Researcher utilities:** Built-in protocol validation for easy learning and debugging.

## How it fits into your workflow

**Typical cycle**

Draft a protocol (in the Android app or using an online editor), review it in Protocol Manager, pilot on a device, adjust styling, then deploy to participants. 

-   **Edit & preview:** Make quick changes inside Protocol Manager or any text editor, then preview on-device.
-   **Distribute resources:** Store accompanying HTML, audio, video, and imagery in the resources folder for playback.

## Project ethos

PoLA is maintained as open-source software to encourage transparent research workflows. Contributions are welcome—whether you are proposing new commands, improving accessibility, or providing study templates.
