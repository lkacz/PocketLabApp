## Why PoLA exists

PoLA puts full experimental control in your pocket. It was designed for researchers who need to deliver structured tasks, capture responses in the field, and adapt protocols quickly without recompiling an app. Studies are stored as human-readable text files that PoLA interprets at runtime, enabling rapid iteration, reproducibility, and transparent auditing.

Sessions can range from brief questionnaires to multi-stage experiments with timers, branching, custom layouts, and embedded media. Participants interact with a touch-first interface, while facilitators benefit from precise timing, robust logging, and straightforward data exports.

## Key capabilities

-   **Protocol-driven workflow:** Update tasks instantly by editing a plain-text script—no rebuild required.
-   **Protocol Manager GUI:** Author and troubleshoot studies visually, then refine the underlying script when needed.
-   **Rich participant experiences:** Combine instructions, timers, scales, free response fields, HTML overlays, audio, video, and images in a single flow.
-   **Detailed logging:** Automatic study logs capture navigation events, timestamps, and device context for auditing.
-   **Flexible styling:** Tune typography, alignment, spacing, and button treatments to match your branding or accessibility goals.
-   **Randomization & branching:** Shuffle stimuli, branch to labeled sections, and orchestrate complex study paths with simple commands.
-   **Offline-first execution:** Run complete studies without a network connection and export data securely when ready.
-   **Researcher utilities:** Built-in protocol validation, undo/redo, quick fixes, and developer tools streamline iteration.

## How it fits into your workflow

**Typical cycle**

Draft a protocol, review it in Protocol Manager, pilot on a device, adjust styling, then deploy to participants. Exported data can be synchronized with your analysis pipeline immediately after each run.

-   **Edit & preview:** Make quick changes inside Protocol Manager or any text editor, then preview on-device.
-   **Distribute resources:** Store accompanying HTML, audio, video, and imagery in the resources folder for seamless playback.
-   **Monitor progress:** Leverage session logs and optional developer tools to diagnose issues in the field.

## Project ethos

PoLA is maintained as open-source software to encourage transparent research workflows. Contributions are welcome—whether you are proposing new commands, improving accessibility, translating UI strings, or documenting study templates.
