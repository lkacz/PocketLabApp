// LOG command writes an informational entry into the exported execution log.
LOG;[INFO] Tutorial appearance configured and ready

// INSTRUCTION with multimedia placeholders for audio, video, and HTML references.
INSTRUCTION;Welcome to the complete PoLA tutorial;This slide explains that every command, variant, and styling option will be demonstrated in this run. Explore the narration, ambient loop, and sample video to see how multimedia placeholders append to the body text.<tutorial_voiceover.mp3,70> <tutorial_ambient_loop.wav,40> <tutorial_checkpoint_video.mp4>;Begin the feature tour

// HTML command opens the immersive briefing that accompanies this protocol. The continue action is protected with a hold gesture.
HTML;immersive_briefing.html;Return to the tutorial flow[HOLD]

// TIMER illustrates scheduled reminders; the continue button still requires a hold gesture to reinforce intent.
TIMER;Timed reminder demo;This TIMER waits 10 seconds to simulate a delayed prompt, reminding participants that timed tasks are possible within PoLA.;10;Ready for the next feature[HOLD]

// TIMER_SOUND plays a chime from the resources folder once the preceding timer completes.
TIMER_SOUND;tutorial_success_chime.wav

// SCALE captures a single rating with descriptive anchors.
SCALE;Confidence check;Rate how confident you feel about navigating PoLA commands after reviewing the introduction.;Confidence level;Very unsure;Somewhat unsure;Neutral;Growing confident;Highly confident

// SCALE[RANDOMIZED] presents response anchors in the same order but randomizes item presentation.
SCALE[RANDOMIZED];Randomized scale example;This randomized scale reorders internal response items each run to reduce ordering bias.;Randomized item;Strongly disagree;Disagree;Neutral;Agree;Strongly agree

// INPUTFIELD collects structured text responses in a fixed order.
INPUTFIELD;Collecting practice feedback;Provide a short reflection and any questions you want to flag for later follow-up.;Share my notes;Reflection;Open question

// INPUTFIELD[RANDOMIZED] shuffles field prompts to mitigate position effects during data entry.
INPUTFIELD[RANDOMIZED];Randomized response fields;These prompts shuffle between runs so participants encounter the fields in a fresh order.;Save responses;Idea one;Idea two;Idea three

// Demonstrate RANDOMIZE_ON / RANDOMIZE_OFF to shuffle enclosed command order.
INSTRUCTION;Preparing randomized micro-slides;The next two informational slides are wrapped in RANDOMIZE_ON/OFF to show how entire fragments can appear in a different sequence each run.;Continue to randomized slides
RANDOMIZE_ON
INSTRUCTION;Randomized spotlight A;This randomized slide highlights how you can shuffle motivational messages to keep longer studies engaging.;Mark this randomized slide complete
INSTRUCTION;Randomized spotlight B;This alternate randomized slide explains that RANDOMIZE_ON ends when RANDOMIZE_OFF is encountered, preserving the rest of the flow.;Mark this randomized slide complete
RANDOMIZE_OFF

// LABEL provides a named anchor and GOTO skips the optional slide that follows.
INSTRUCTION;Branching control example;This instruction triggers a GOTO to skip the optional deep dive slide and land on the labelled destination ahead.;Jump to the labelled destination
GOTO;CONTENT_CONTROLS
INSTRUCTION;Optional deep dive (should be skipped);If you are reading this slide, the GOTO demonstration needs review because it should have skipped directly to the label.;Continue if visible
LABEL;CONTENT_CONTROLS
INSTRUCTION;Label destination overview;You landed on the CONTENT_CONTROLS label. Labels let you target specific slides from GOTO commands to manage alternate study paths.;Proceed to styling recap

// LOG entries can be used mid-study to capture milestones that are mirrored in exported data.
LOG;[INFO] Participant reached content control showcase

// Alignment, sizing, and color choices already applied remain active as we introduce final reminders.
INSTRUCTION;Styling recap and hold token;Notice that all appearance and hold token decisions made earlier are still in effect, keeping presentation consistent while demonstrating every configuration command.;Move to final checks[HOLD]

// FINAL instruction summarises pending tasks before concluding the tutorial.
INSTRUCTION;Before closing the full tutorial;You have now interacted with every PoLA command, including styling controls, randomization blocks, labels, gotos, multimedia attachments, timers, sounds, and input forms. Review the exported log to confirm both LOG entries appear.;Finish and export data

// END command marks completion of the protocol.
